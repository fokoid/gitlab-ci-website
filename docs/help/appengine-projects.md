To host your site, or an application more generally, on App Engine, you will
need a project. Follow the instructions below to create two projects. One will
be for the production site and will be publicly available. The other will be a
private staging area where you (and other authorized users) can preview changes.

## Prerequisites

* Google Cloud Platform account (e.g. a regular Google account)

## Creating App Engine Projects

_In progress._

Note: you do not have to do anything to make the staging application private.
This is handled for you by the `app_staging.yml` file from the GitLab CI for
websites project.
